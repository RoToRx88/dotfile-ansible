# Dotfile managed with ansible

## Description

Basic dotfile repo with a new approch to it.


## Motivations

I wanted to learn how to use ansible and didn't have any dotfile rep already done.
I thought that it was a great idea to start learning ansible this way.

This is a work in progress and is by no means something you should use to setup your environment.
